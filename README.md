## Using the starter
To use this as a starter for a new project, replace `dirformynewrepo`
and execute in the following commands:

```
git clone --depth=1 --branch=master git://someserver/somerepo dirformynewrepo
rm -rf !$/.git
```

## Installing and usage

Then, simply run:

and load up `localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/index.html` for
live-reloaded changes. If you make changes to the html file, you'll need
